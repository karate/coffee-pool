# Enterprise Coffee Pooling

Let your people decide when they're going to meet up to get some coffee.

## Features:
- [x] Real-time updates using WebSockets
- [ ] Browser notifications
- [x] Allow users to set-up availability windows (I'll go grab a coffee in the next 2 hours)
- [ ] Allow users to broadcast an emergency event (I'm going to get a coffee right now)
- [ ] Show suggestions

## Technologies:
This started as a weekend project. My goal is to keep it as lightweight as possible.

This means, only necessary node packages on the server, and no external JS dependencies
on the client.

Currently using:
- Node.js server (with `websocket`, `serve-static` and `finalhandler`)
- Pure Object Oriented JS client
- Nothing else!
